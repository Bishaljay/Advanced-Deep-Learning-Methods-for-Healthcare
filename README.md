# Advanced Deep Learning Methods for Healthcare

This repository explores advanced deep learning techniques and their applications in the healthcare domain. It includes implementations of state-of-the-art neural network models for tasks such as medical image classification, disease prediction, patient data analysis, and drug discovery.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

* âœ… Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for medical imaging (e.g., tumor detection, X-ray/CT scan classification)
* âœ… Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs for time-series patient data (e.g., health monitoring, EHR analysis)
* âœ… Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation and synthetic medical data generation
* âœ… Transformers and Attention Mechanisms for medical text processing and clinical report generation
* âœ… Transfer Learning for leveraging pre-trained models on medical datasets
* âœ… Explainable AI (XAI) methods for model interpretability in healthcare
